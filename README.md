This repository contains artificial intelligence coursework based on UC Berkely introduction to AI (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188)

## Project 1 - Search
Implementation of various search methods using Pacman agent to find paths through maze world.
1. Depth First Search using fixed food dot
2. Breadth First Search
3. A* search
4. Various path finding scenarios, such as varying cost function, finding all corners, eating all dots
5. Implementation of heuristic function for finding all corners problem
Contained in search.py and searchAgent.py, rest of project files can be found in zip archive

## Project 2 - Multi-Agent Search

1. Simple reflex agents
2. Minimax search between Pacman and adversarial ghosts
3. Alpha-Beta pruning
4. Expectimax search bewteen Pacman and adversarial ghosts
5. Implementation of evaluation function
Contained in multiAgents.py, rest of project files can be found in zip archive
